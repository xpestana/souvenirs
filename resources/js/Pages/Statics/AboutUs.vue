                    <p class="text-white mb-20">Hotel rooms and tourist apartments play a crucial role in our business model. They are the places where the traveler spends an important period of
                        time and where you will have the opportunity to hire our services from your own smartphone or tablet. In order for the client to have the possibility of entering our platform, it is necessary that they observe the box with the informative brochure, so it must be visible so that it enters the visual horizon of the traveler, such as in the
                        nightstand, dresser or on the main dining table. With this positioning, discreet but effective at the same time, we will get the customer to fix their attention on our
                        claim and use our services. Both the tables and the brochures are provided and installed by HiCitty to our collaborators, who only have to keep them in the
                        where it was positioned. No type of maintenance or review by the owner of the tourist home is necessary. In addition, our collaborators will be given a range of frame colors to choose from so that they can choose which one best suits the environment and decoration of the accommodation, as well as different sizes and shapes.
                    in order to attract more clients without altering or impacting the decoration and layout of the apartment or room.</p>

Since we are aware of how important the place where our client is staying is for our business model, we offer
                        to our collaborators no more and no less than 20% of the final total of the customer's purchase. Let's take an example: A traveler stays in his accommodation, decides to scan the QR and buy a tour of the Real Alcázar of Seville for him and his partner, in addition to buying a couple of cups for relatives in his hometown. The total amount paid by this
                        traveler to HiCitty is €100, so you would get to win €20. That's right, as simple as that! Surely you are wondering, how do I calculate what has been purchased from my accommodation? Don't worry, at HiCitty we have developed a method whereby from the moment the QR code of your room or apartment is scanned, all the purchases you make will be related to your accommodation. In addition, you will have a user on our platform where you can access a wallet and check all the
                        transactions that have been made from your property. With HiCitty the disorganized traveler wins, the accommodation they stay in wins and we win.
                    In short, we all win.</p>
