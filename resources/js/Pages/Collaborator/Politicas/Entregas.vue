                        <p>The contracting of any of the activities offered at https://hicitty.com implies full acceptance of these general conditions and the particular conditions of said activity, which will be considered automatically incorporated into the contracting without the need for a written transcript, forcing to both parties to its fulfillment</p><br>
                        <p>The reservation of a place for an activity by the Client will be considered valid, and with the rights that this implies subject to the weather conditions and the physical environment where they take place, which can be very changeable, and physical conditions of the people who participate in activity.</p><br>

                        <p>The providers of the activity may vary, if they deem it appropriate, the previously established routes, or the duration of the activities themselves, depending on the existing conditions in the area or the characteristics of the group of participants, without this reason implying right to economic reimbursement of the registration to the participants once the activity itself begins.</p><br>
                        <p>The supplier will act as responsible for the activity, strictly speaking, from the moment it begins and until the end of it. The supplier's responsibility affects only the direct work and the organization of the activity itself (except in cases where the contrary is indicated), not being responsible in any way for external services to the same (for example, transport of the participants to the place of the start of the activity, state of the roads, lodging, meals, or any other service that is contracted and paid directly by the Client).</p><br>

                        <p>Cittyvities S.L reserves the right not to allow participation in the contracted activity, without any right to claim or refund the economic amounts previously paid, to the person/s who on the same day of the activity do not have the material indicated as MANDATORY , or it is considered by the person in charge appointed by Cittyvities S.L that it is not suitable to carry out the activity due to the intrinsic characteristics of the activity itself.</p><br>

                        <p>At all times, the participants agree to accept and be subject to the rules and instructions of the providers of the activity.</p><br>

                        <p>Those under 18 years of age who participate in the activities must be accompanied by their parents or legal guardians, who are responsible for them.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>In the event of any conflict that should be resolved in court, both parties will submit to the jurisprudence of the courts of Seville.</p><br>
                        <p>The fact of participating in any of the activities of Cittyvities S.L implies the reading and acceptance of these General Conditions. Ignorance of the same does not exempt the Client from their compliance.</p><br>

                        <p>Cittyvities S.L reserves the Right of Admission in its activities of Clients who fail to comply, or have previously failed to comply, with the General Conditions of Contract.</p><br>
