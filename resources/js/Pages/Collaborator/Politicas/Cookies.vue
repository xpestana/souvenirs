                        <p>HiCitty informs about the use of cookies on its website: www.hicitty.com</p><br>

                        <p><b>What are cookies?</b></p><br>

                        <p>Cookies are files that can be downloaded to your computer through web pages. They are tools that play an essential role in the provision of numerous information society services. Among others, they allow a web page to store and retrieve information about the browsing habits of a user or their equipment and, depending on the information obtained, they can be used to recognize the user and improve the service offered.</p><br>
                        
                        <p><b>Types of cookies </b></p><br>

                        <p>Depending on who is the entity that manages the domain from which the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, two types can be distinguished:</p><br>

                        <p>• Own cookies: those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself and from which the service requested by the user is provided.</p><br>
                        <p>• Third-party cookies: those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the publisher, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through cookies.</p><br>
                        <p>In the event that cookies are installed from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself, but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered as own cookies.</p><br>
                        <p>There is also a second classification according to the length of time they remain stored in the client's browser, which may be:</p><br>
                        <p>• Session cookies: designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page. They are usually used to store information that is only interesting to keep for the provision of the service requested by the user on a single occasion (eg a list of products purchased).</p><br>
                        <p>• Persistent cookies: the data is still stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the person responsible for the cookie, which can range from a few minutes to several years.</p><br>
                        <p>Finally, there is another classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the data obtained is processed:</p><br>
                        <p>• Technical cookies: those that allow the user to navigate through a web page, platform or application and the use of the different options or services that exist in it, such as, for example, controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session , access restricted access parts, remember the elements that make up an order, carry out the purchase process of an order, make the request for registration or participation in an event, use security elements during navigation, store content for the dissemination of videos or sound or share content through social networks.</p><br>
                        <p>• Personalization cookies: they allow the user to access the service with some predefined general characteristics based on a series of criteria in the user's terminal, such as the language, the type of browser through which the service is accessed, the configuration region from where you access the service, etc.</p><br>
                        <p>• Analysis cookies: they allow the person responsible for them to monitor and analyze the behavior of the users of the websites to which they are linked. The information collected through this type of cookie is used to measure the activity of the websites, applications or platforms and to create browsing profiles of the users of said sites, applications and platforms, in order to introduce improvements in function of the analysis of the usage data made by the users of the service.</p><br>

                        <p>• Advertising cookies: they allow the management, in the most efficient way possible, of advertising spaces.</p><br>
                        <p>• Behavioral advertising cookies: they store information on the behavior of users obtained through the continuous observation of their browsing habits, which allows the development of a specific profile to display advertising based on it. </p><br>
                        <p>• External social network cookies: they are used so that visitors can interact with the content of different social platforms (facebook, youtube, twitter, linkedIn, etc.) and that they are generated only for the users of said social networks. The conditions of use of these cookies and the information collected is regulated by the privacy policy of the corresponding social platform.</p><br>
